servicePortBlocker is a Java/Groovy app.

It starts an extremely minimal server which listens on the port
 identified in servicePortBlocker.groovy.

The server does nothing with any requests it receives.
It sends nothing back to anything which contacts it.
It simply occupies a port on your system, blocking any other servers
 from binding to that port.

This can be useful when running Grails functional tests against a
 server on a different machine because it prevents Grails from
 starting a server on the local machine.
When running an application such as CCSDAS, this saves a LOT of time at
 application startup, thus considerably shortening the feedback loop.
